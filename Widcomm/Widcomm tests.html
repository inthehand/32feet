   <h2>
       Widcomm no Radio present</h2>
    <p>
        bug 23222. &nbsp; On Win32 (XP) test of Widcomm radio dongle unplugged.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>With Radio dongle attached, all should work: PrimaryRadio/AllRadios should include
            the Widcomm radio (if no MSFT present, or multi-radio enabled).</li>
        <li> Unplug the radio.&nbsp; Now PrimaryRadio should return null, etc.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The failing behaviour is for a empty radio instance to be returned, like:</p>
    <pre>        option>10

        &nbsp; Against any device, at least one record should be listed, the SDP 
        server record itself.&nbsp; The device may have other records.</p>
    <p>
        Note that we cannot dump the whole record as Widcomm does not provide access
        to the raw record bytes.  Check the documentation for the Attributes we lookup (currently
        only the Service Class, and Name, and RFCOMM Channel Number).</p>
    <p>
        Also need to do a specific class query to check we filter correctly.&nbsp; Widcomm
        returns *all* the records read in the current session, so we have to filter the
        matching ones in GetServiceRecords.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Do a query for a specific class id e.g. OPP. </li>
        <li>Then query for all (L2CAP). </li>
        <li>Then do a query for the first class again. You should see only the record(s) listed
            originally, and not those listed in the &#x2018;all&#x2019; step.
            <br />
            (Originally we behaved as: see correct result for the original query, but all records
            are listed after the &#x2018;all&#x2019; query). </li>

    <h2>
        WidcommDeviceInfo get_Remembered versus get_Authenticated</h2>
    <p>
        We want to check that we see devices of the two types: {Remembered=true, Authenticated=false}
        and {Remembered=true, Authenticated=true}. This requires that we have
        at least one device in Widcomm's &#x201C;Trusted Devices&#x201D; set.</p>
    <p>
        Run discovery with at least remembered=authentication=true, discoverableOnly must
        be false, unknown is better set to false also.</p>
    <p>
        In Widcomm a device is &#x2018;remembered&#x2019; whenever the stack sees it 
        &#x2014; unlike MSFT where manual request is required.
        One may need to force a device to be trusted &#x2014; either by calling BluetoothSecurity.PairRequest,
        or by making a connection with it to a service requiring authentication.</p>
    <p>
        A nice test to is to have a trusted device and then make it untrusted (either BluetoothSecurity.RemoveDevice,
        or use the Widcomm UI e.g. on WM do {Wireless XX -&gt; Manage -&gt; Advanced menu
        -&gt; Trusted Devices -&gt; Remove} and on two discovery process see it R+A and
        then R-A.</p>
    <h2>
        BluetoothSecurity (PairRequest, RemoveDevice)</h2>
    <p>
        In a similar area to the above, here testing whether we can add and remove devices
        from the trusted list. Choose a peer device that is in range and you can bond
        with. Run discovery(auth+rmbd) and/or use the Widcomm UI to view trusted device
        and see the device removed from the trusted list with <strong>RemoveDevice</strong> 
        and added with <strong>PairRequest</strong>.</p>

    <h2>
        WidcommBluetoothClient</h2>
    <p>
        In BluetoothClient we have to do a manual SDP lookup (unless the port is set in
        the specified BluetoothEndPoint), thus there's some complexity around that.&nbsp;
        There's the test below 'BluetoothClient' which does SvcA-&gt;SvcB-&gt;SvcA.&nbsp;
        The SDP Lookup takes 12 seconds to time-out when the target device is not found.</p>
    <h3>
        Connect works</h3>
    <p>
        Connect to a remote service, e.g. OBEX or SerialPort on most device types, or 1113
        to another instance on ConsoleMenuTesting.</p>
    <p>
        If the port (RFCOMM SCN) is specified in the endpoint then the process is less complex
        (no SDP lookup) though not worth testing that in most cases.</p>
    <h3>
        Connect (SDP) take a while to time-out</h3>
    <p>
        Start a Connect to a non-existent device, it will take a while (12secs) for the
        SDP lookup to fail.&nbsp; See that that delay (only) occurs.</p>
    <p>
        We would like to report a useful Winsock Error code but Widcomm doesn't tell us
        if the failure was not-present, security, or something else.&nbsp; So ignore the
        exception error code.</p>
    <h3>
        Restricted to one Connect (SDP) at a time</h3>
    <p>
        Use ConsoleMenuTesting option: "ConnectMultiple".</p>
    <h3>
        Connect can be cancelled</h3>
    <p>
        Start a Connect to a non-existent device, it will take a while (12secs) for the
        SDP lookup to fail.&nbsp; In that time call BluetoothClient.Close and the sync/async
        Connect will fail with a ObjDispEx (we only test the async case from the same thread
        here).&nbsp; Later the SDP lookup will complete, and it will NOT crash!</p>
    <h3>
        Cancelled Connect doesn't allow the next immediately</h3>
    <p>
        Here we can see that we aren't able to do another connect immediately when we cancel
        a previous connect.&nbsp; We have to wait for the SDP to complete first.&nbsp; The
        current script in ConsoleMenuTesting is as following.&nbsp; It runs two Connect,
        the first as async=Y, cancel=Y; and we expect to see the second fail with "one at
        a time" InvOpEx.</p>

        Connections close at switch Radio Off</h2>
    <p>
        bug 28623. &nbsp; [widcomm] Use OnStackStatusChange to close connections when radio
        turned off</p>
    <p>
        On PDAs when the radio is turned off when there is an current RFCOMM connection,
        no connection loss event is received, so the program there thinks the connection
        is still open, and will hang on a Read for instance (the remote end sees the connection
        close due to 20s timeout).&nbsp; So we need to listen for the radio-off event and
        manually close any connections then.&nbsp; Note that on my iPAQ hx2710 with Widcomm
        1.7.1.1424 when the radio is switched off a CONN_ERR event <strong>is</strong> recevied,
        this is not the case on my Asus device nor a newer iPAQ I&#39;ve tested on.</p>
    <p>
        This functionality is not implemented on the desktop PC platform, we saw wierd/bad
        things happening when implemented.&nbsp; The radio-off situation is less likely
        to happen then, e.g. less need for saving power, so its not important to implement
        it there, we&#39;ll look at it again based on demand.&nbsp; (The wierd/bad thing
        was that after the native code called up into the managed code to report the OnStackStatusChange
        event things went all wrong).</p>
    <p>
        We need to test the connection(s) are closed.&nbsp; We should also test that the
        infrastructure is working correctly, that the list of open connections is maintained
        correctly, being added to at both <em>client</em> and <em>server</em> connect, and
        the connection is removed from the list when it <em>closes</em>.</p>
    <h3>
        Test using DeviceMenuTesting</h3>
    <p>
        1. Make a client connection to a remote machine and close the connection.&nbsp;
        Run a server on the PDA and connect to it from a remote machine, and close the connection.</p>
    <p>
        2. Run a server on the PDA and connect to it from a remote machine, and start a
        Read on the connection.</p>
    <p>
        3. In Wireless Manager or similar turn off the radio.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check the connection has been closed, i.e. the Read returned 0=EoF.</li>
        <li>Check that a Write fails with an IOException wrapping a SocketException (and not
            an ObjectDisposedException).</li>
        <li>Check that the number of closes reported the off-handler is one (e.g. "<code>PortKill_Runner
            done (1)</code>") &#x2014; i.e. the two previous connections were correctly removed
            from the list when they closed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        4. Re-enable the radio, restart DeviceMenuTesting (if required &#x2013; or use HackShutdown),
        make a client connection to a remote machine.&nbsp; Turn off the radio, and start
        a Read on the connection.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check the connection has been closed, i.e. the Read returned 0=EoF etc.</li>
    </ul>

        <dt>Microsoft stack on Windows CE / Windows Mobile</dt>
        <dd>A socket option is available which sets the PIN to use for all purposes 
            on that socket.  A device address can optionally be provided to specify

        <dt>Microsoft stack on desktop Windows</dt>
        <dd>No socket option is available.  The only feature is an event raised 
            for all requests for a PIN.  In the library this is provided by class 
            <code>BluetoothWin32Authentication</code>.  It can be used in two forms,
            firstly in an automatic mode where the caller specifies a device address
            and the pin and it should use to authenticate to that address.  
            In the second mode the caller supplies a callback method which can 
            respond to the PIN requests.
            </dd>
        <dt>Broadcom/Widcomm stack on both platforms</dt>
        <dd>No &lsquo;socket&rsquo; option is available.  No event for PIN requests 
            is provided either.  The only PIN related method is CBtIf::Bond which 
            <em>actively</em> bonds using the given PIN.
            </dd>
        </dl>
    <h3>Functional spec</h3>
    <p>
        Default method should be for the user to call <code>SetPin(String pin)</code> 
        before connect, which specifies that that pin is to be used this connection, 
        or at least that the PIN should be used for the device that this instance is 
        connecting to.&nbsp; There will also be a SetPin(BluetoothAddress device,String pin) method, but I'm not
        sure of its use.</p>
    <p>
        The use of these after a connection is made is not obvious to me.&nbsp; By then
        the PIN is not required since the connection has been successful without one!</p>
    <h3>
        Implementation</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>
        On WM/CE, the socket option should be used for both methods: for <code>SetPin(string)</code> 
        without the device address, and for <code>SetPin(BluetoothAddress,String)</code>
        with the address.
        <cite><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms863363.aspx">
        BTH_SOCKOPT_SECURITY in the Windows CE docs</a></cite></li>
    <li>On desktop Windows:
        <ul> 
        <li><code>SetPin(BluetoothAddress,String)</code> should
            start an ‘automatic’ BluetoothWin32Authenticator using the two parameters.
            </li>
        <li>When <code>SetPin(string)</code> is called <em>before</em> the instance
            is connected, it should store the pin.  When the caller later initiates 
            a connection the device address from the connect
            call along with the stored pin should be used to start an &lsquo;automatic&rsquo;
            BluetoothWin32Authenticator.</li>
        <li>When <code>SetPin(string)</code> is called called after connection 
            the connected remote device address can be used.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    <li>On Widcomm no obvious useful method is apparent.&nbsp; We've implemented the 
        following: try to connect and if it fails to call <code>CBtIf::Bond()</code> and try 
        the connect again.&nbsp;
        However, at least with the Microsoft stack as the peer device, that is not useful
        &#x2014; the Bond operation fails.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tests</h3>

    <dt>1. With <code>BluetoothClient</code>, Connect to a service on an unbonded device,
        where the service or device requires authentication.</dt>
    <dd>Expect failure</dd>
    <dt>2. Do again, this time first calling <code>SetPin(pin)</code> on the BluetoothClient.</dt>
    <dd>Expect success: the PIN is used automatically, the devices bond, and the 
        connection succeeds.</dd>
    <dt>3. Do again, this time first calling <code>SetPin(address,pin)</code> on the BluetoothClient.</dt>
    <dd>First delete the bonding on the peer device and re-test #1.<br />
        Expect success: the PIN is used automatically, the devices bond, and the

        on the BluetoothClient.</dt>
